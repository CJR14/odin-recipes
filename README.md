    i'm not 100% sure what i'm doing but i am following ToP's guide and so far finding it quite easy. 
    this is a public test. 
    excuse my inexperience and excuse me for sounding... not smart
    the skills i have gained and demonstrated to myself is navigating everything via the terminal,
    creating, editing and deleting directories in an unsafe and a safe manner.
    i'm gaining confidence in my ability to work the the complicated side of computations.
    HELP ME... not really, i find this quite entertaining and overcoming the challenges make me feel amazing.


    coming back because the terminal didn't react the way Git Basics said it would.
    tried "git add README.md which worked fine.
    tried "git push origin main" everything seemed to work and it uploaded to git hub.
    checked "git status" and the push was in red. cleared terminal (big mistake)
    unsure if it's working properly but it's something i get to come back to.

    well somehow i manage to creat a file called 'git push origin main' instead of the file being pushed.
    let's see if i can do it again but without far-king it up

    kinda getting the hang of it.
    and yes i am laughing at myself too, enjoyable watching noobs learn. (giggity)

    well i figured it out.. i think.
    for a proper commit message to help me later;
    use git add
    git commit -m "message here"
    git push origin main OR git push
