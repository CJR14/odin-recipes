    i'm not 100% sure what i'm doing but i am following ToP's guide and so far finding it quite easy. 
    this is a public test. 
    excuse my inexperience and excuse me for sounding... not smart
    the skills i have gained and demonstrated to myself is navigating everything via the terminal,
    creating, editing and deleting directories in an unsafe and a safe manner.
    i'm gaining confidence in my ability to work the the complicated side of computations.
    HELP ME... not really, i find this quite entertaining and overcoming the challenges make me feel amazing.
